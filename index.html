<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>App Name:</strong> I HAVE IT – BECAUSE I CAN<br>
<strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 2025</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to <em>I HAVE IT – BECAUSE I CAN</em> (“the App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application. By using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Account Information:</strong> When you sign in with Google, we collect your email address only. This is used to verify your ownership and associate your certificate with your account.</li>
  <li><strong>Firebase Data:</strong> The App uses Google Firebase (Firestore) to store technical data such as your unique user ID and your certificate number (for limited edition tracking).</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not collect your name, location, photos, contacts, or any personal data beyond the email address used for authentication.</p>

<h2>3. How We Use the Information</h2>
<p>We use the collected data solely to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authenticate your account via Google Sign-In</li>
  <li>Assign and store your limited-edition certificate number</li>
  <li>Ensure accurate tracking of the total 10,000 editions worldwide</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use your data for marketing, analytics, or advertising.</p>

<h2>4. Payments</h2>
<p>The App is available as a one-time paid purchase through Google Play. All transactions are handled securely by Google Play Billing. We do not process or store any payment information ourselves.</p>

<h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>We do not share, sell, or transfer your personal data to any third parties. Data is stored securely within Firebase (Google Cloud Platform) and protected by Google’s privacy and security standards.</p>

<h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
<p>Your certificate data remains stored as long as your Google account is associated with the App. If you uninstall the App, your data remains securely stored in Firebase unless you request deletion.</p>

<h2>7. Account Deletion</h2>
<p>Users can request the deletion of their account and all related data at any time by contacting us at 
<a href="mailto:ihaveitluxuryapp@gmail.com">ihaveitluxuryapp@gmail.com</a>. 
Once the request is verified, all user data stored in Firebase — including the Google email, user ID, and certificate number — will be permanently deleted within 30 days. 
After deletion, the user’s access to the app will be revoked, and the certificate will no longer be available.</p>

<h2>8. Security</h2>
<p>We take reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>

<h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>This App is not intended for children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect or store any data from minors.</p>

<h2>10. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or wish to delete your data, please contact us at:<br>
📧 <a href="mailto:ihaveitluxuryapp@gmail.com">ihaveitluxuryapp@gmail.com</a></p>

<h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App or on the official website. Continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.</p>

<h2>✅ Summary</h2>
